# Feature Specification: Project Management System with Automated Workflows

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-ultimate-outcome`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The ultimate outcome will be a seamlessly deployed project management system, enhanced by agent-driven, automated CI/CD and TDD workflows, all underpinned by comprehensive documentation that fosters continuous iteration and improvement."

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager, I want a project management system that automates development workflows so that I can focus on delivering features faster and with higher quality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new feature is proposed, **When** a developer starts working on it, **Then** the system automatically creates a new feature branch and a task in the project management system.
2. **Given** a developer commits code to a feature branch, **When** the code is pushed to the repository, **Then** the CI/CD pipeline automatically runs tests and provides feedback.
3. **Given** a feature is ready for deployment, **When** the feature branch is merged into the main branch, **Then** the system automatically deploys the feature to production.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a test fails in the CI/CD pipeline?
- How does the system handle merge conflicts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a project management interface to create, update, and track tasks.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST integrate with a version control system to automate branch creation.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST include a CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST support Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflows. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific support for TDD is required?]
- **FR-005**: The system MUST be agent-driven. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific tasks for the agents? What kind of agents?]
- **FR-006**: The system MUST have comprehensive documentation.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST be seamlessly deployed. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific deployment targets and requirements?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Represents a project with a name, description, and a set of tasks.
- **Task**: Represents a unit of work with a title, description, status, and assignee.
- **User**: Represents a user of the system with a name and email.
- **Feature Branch**: Represents a branch in the version control system associated with a task.
