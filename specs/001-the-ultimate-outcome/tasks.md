# Tasks: Project Management System with Automated Workflows

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-the-ultimate-outcome/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 [P] Initialize backend project with FastAPI in `backend/`
- [ ] T002 [P] Initialize frontend project with React (TypeScript) in `frontend/`
- [ ] T003 [P] Set up Docker for backend and frontend with `docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] T004 [P] Configure linting and formatting for backend (e.g., `ruff`, `black`)
- [ ] T005 [P] Configure linting and formatting for frontend (e.g., `eslint`, `prettier`)

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T006 [P] Create contract test for User creation in `backend/tests/contract/test_users.py`
- [ ] T007 [P] Create contract test for Project creation in `backend/tests/contract/test_projects.py`
- [ ] T008 [P] Create contract test for Task creation in `backend/tests/contract/test_tasks.py`
- [ ] T009 [P] Create integration test for user registration and login in `backend/tests/integration/test_auth.py`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T010 [P] Create User model in `backend/src/models/user.py`
- [ ] T011 [P] Create Project model in `backend/src/models/project.py`
- [ ] T012 [P] Create Task model in `backend/src/models/task.py`
- [ ] T013 [P] Create FeatureBranch model in `backend/src/models/feature_branch.py`
- [ ] T014 Create database schema with Alembic in `backend/src/alembic/`
- [ ] T015 Implement User API endpoints (CRUD) in `backend/src/api/users.py`
- [ ] T016 Implement Project API endpoints (CRUD) in `backend/src/api/projects.py`
- [ ] T017 Implement Task API endpoints (CRUD) in `backend/src/api/tasks.py`
- [ ] T018 [P] Create basic project structure (components, pages, services) in `frontend/src/`
- [ ] T019 [P] Create User authentication pages (login, signup) in `frontend/src/pages/auth/`
- [ ] T020 [P] Create Project list page in `frontend/src/pages/projects/`
- [ ] T021 [P] Create Project detail page with task list in `frontend/src/pages/projects/[id].tsx`
- [ ] T022 [P] Create Task detail page in `frontend/src/pages/tasks/[id].tsx`

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T023 Connect frontend to backend APIs in `frontend/src/services/`
- [ ] T024 Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD in `.github/workflows/`

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T025 [P] Add documentation to backend code
- [ ] T026 [P] Add documentation to frontend code
- [ ] T027 [P] Implement logging and monitoring

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T005) before everything
- Tests (T006-T009) before implementation (T010-T022)
- Models (T010-T013) before API endpoints (T015-T017)
- Backend implementation before frontend integration (T023)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T001-T005 together:
Task: "Initialize backend project with FastAPI in backend/"
Task: "Initialize frontend project with React (TypeScript) in frontend/"
Task: "Set up Docker for backend and frontend with docker-compose.yml"
Task: "Configure linting and formatting for backend (e.g., ruff, black)"
Task: "Configure linting and formatting for frontend (e.g., eslint, prettier)"
```
